My main repo (which houses all my coastal PhD tools) is [COASTGUARD (Coastal Observation + Analysis using Satellite-derived Timeseries, Generated Using AI + Real-time Data)](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD). COASTGUARD is where you can find the [VedgeSat tool](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/blob/master/VedgeSat_Driver_EXAMPLE.py) for automatically extracting vegetation edges from Landsat, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery.

### My Bio

I'm currently a PhD student in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow. My ultimate research goal is to create a satellite-driven framework for predicting shoreline change in response to short-term weather events, in a range of coastal environments. My PhD so far has focused on extracting novel metrics for coastal change (such as the coastal vegetation edge) from publicly available satellite observations. If it's free, and it's near-global in coverage, I want get the most information from it in the most automated way possible! Prior to my PhD, I was the sole research assistant on the [Dynamic Coast]() project (also at the University of Glasgow), which aims to fill Scotland's national evidence base of coastal change. I studied Geology & Physical Geography and Geographical Information Science at the University of Edinburgh, which is where my love of natural hazard monitoring and prediction, spatial visualisation, science communication, and machine learning first came about. I'm also passionate about tools and techniques for planetary observation (apart from Earth!) and Space exploration, and am currently helping [design and build a nanosatellite for rapid UK coastal monitoring](https://www.oirthirsat.space/team-1).

When I grow up I want to work for a Space agency.
